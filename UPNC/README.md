### Creation of a TSV file to have annotation of PUs

## Run the "TABLE.sh" file

# Input file : 
- UNIQ_SORT.txt : file containing a list of sorted and filtered PUs and coming from the file "LISTS_CATFS_PU_PROTOTYPE_with_fused_famillies".
  SET_UPNC.txt -> sorted -> SORT.txt -> filtered (without duplicates) -> UNIQ_SORT.txt 
- Test.txt : list of 34 PUs - file used to test on a small dataset (used only during code creation to verify that it works).
- PDBChains : folder containing the positions of each PUs essential to recover the start and end positions.

# Output file :
- TABLE_UPNC.tsv : file containing all annotations of PUs. 
- files_not_found.txt : file not found in PDBChains folder. 
  ex:/home/qcapdet/M2BI/Projet_long/Project_PUs/UPNC/PDBChains/1aym_2/1aym_2_resnum_corresp_uniprot.tsv

### Other files & folders :
- SAVE : folder with an old version of TABLE.save.
- PDB : folder which contains the PUs PDB files coming from RCSB-PDB.   
- ALPHADB : folder which contains the PUs PDB file coming from AlphaFold Protein Structure Database.
- ESMATLAS : folder which contains the PUs PDB file generated by ESM Metagenomic Atlas.

- Correspondence : folder for the correspondant between the IDs of the original pdb PUs and UniProt.
